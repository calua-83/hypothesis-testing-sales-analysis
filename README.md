# hypothesis-testing-sales-analysis
This project focuses on using statistical methods to test hypotheses, conduct advanced statistical analyses, and provide actionable insights based on the results.The analysis explores relationships between key business variables, helping inform data-driven decisions.

- **Hypothesis 2:** Sales performance varies significantly between different customer channels (Hospital vs. Pharmacy).
- **Hypothesis 3:** Sales are higher in urban areas compared to rural areas due to population density and healthcare infrastructure.

## Objectives
- 1.Test hypotheses to confirm or reject the declared hypotheses using appropriate statistical methods.
- 2.Conduct regression analysis, correlation analysis, and other advanced statistical methods to uncover relationships between variables.
- 3.Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis findings.
