# hypothesis-testing-sales-analysis
This project focuses on using statistical methods to test hypotheses, conduct advanced statistical analyses, and provide actionable insights based on the results.The analysis explores relationships between key business variables, helping inform data-driven decisions.

## Hypotheses
- **Hypothesis 1:** Higher product prices correlate with lower sales quantities.
- **Hypothesis 2:** Sales performance varies significantly between different customer channels (Hospital vs. Pharmacy).
- **Hypothesis 3:** Sales are higher in urban areas compared to rural areas due to population density and healthcare infrastructure.

## Objectives
- Test hypotheses to confirm or reject the declared hypotheses using appropriate statistical methods.
- Conduct regression analysis, correlation analysis, and other advanced statistical methods to uncover relationships between variables.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis findings.

## Results
#### Hypothesis 1: Higher Product Prices Correlate with Lower Sales Quantities
- **Analysis** Correlation between price and quantity was tested using Spearman's correlation.
- **Results:**
Correlation coefficient (
ùëü
r): -0.047
P-value: 0.466
-**Conclusion:** The relationship between price and quantity is not statistically significant.
  
#### Hypothesis 2: Sales Performance Varies by Customer Channel
- **Analysis:** Sales data by customer channel (Hospital vs. Pharmacy) was analyzed using ANOVA.
- **Results:**
F-statistic: 4.31
P-value: 0.038
- **Conclusion:** The difference in sales performance between Hospital and Pharmacy channels is statistically significant.
  
#### Hypothesis 3: Urban Areas Outperform Rural Areas in Sales


## Recommendations
- Further investigate price sensitivity to refine pricing strategies, as correlation is weak.
- Develop tailored marketing and resource allocation strategies for Hospitals and Pharmacies based on performance insights.
- Acquire or preprocess additional data to test the urban vs. rural sales hypothesis.
